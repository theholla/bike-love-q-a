  "question": "I'm working on unit testing for a project at code school and .equals() is giving me some trouble. In my project, .save() is saving into a sql database. This code passes the unit test: @Test public void save_assignsNameToObject() {Restaurant testRestaurant = new Restaurant('PokPok','503-444-4444'); testRestaurant.save();   Restaurant savedRestaurant = Restaurant.all.get(0); assertEquals(savedRestaurant.getName(), 'PokPok');} But if I change the final line to the following, it will result in an assertion error: assertTrue(savedRestaurant.equals(testRestaurant));",
